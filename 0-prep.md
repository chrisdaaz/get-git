# Prep and Installation 

To join the wonderful world of version control, please create a GitHub account and install Git on your system.

## 1. Get a GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a Git repository hosting service, a place to store and sync your work in the cloud. 
Take a minute to create a [free account](https://github.com/join).
They provide some great introductory [tutorials](https://guides.github.com/), but you can probably ignore them if you are coming to the workshop!

## 2. Install Git

Git is a version control system, a piece of software on your computer. 
Installing it is pretty easy:

- Windows: install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) using the default options. This will give you Git, Git Bash, and Git GUI. Git Bash is a great terminal that lets you use UNIX style commands and utilities on Windows.
- Mac: check if Git is already installed by opening terminal and typing `git --version`. If you do not have it, download the official [Mac installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Linux: install from your distribution's software center or package manager (for Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install git`).

## *Optional Stuff:*

### Text Editor 

When working with code you should have a good text editor.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard for most cross platform applications. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for working on projects and can often integrate with Git to make your life easier.

Open-source cross platform suggestions:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Git GUIs

This workshop introduces the basic Git workflow using the command line and GitHub web interface. 
However, you may prefer a GUI application for your future day-to-day work with Git.
There are a variety of [GUI apps available](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) for managing and visualizing Git repositories.

If you are interested in using a simple visual app integrated with GitHub, Windows and Mac users should install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) using the default options.
A more powerful alternative is [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) from Atlassian / [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
On Linux [gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/) and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) are good options.
